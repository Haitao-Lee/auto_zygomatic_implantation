# ZygoPlanner: an efficient zygomatic implantation planning framework


![Fig.1 The overview of our pipeline comprises three stages: (a) automatic zygomatic bone positioning through shape-prior-knowledge-based multi-planar cutting. (b) Generation of partitioned alternative trajectories guided by extracting dense 'backlit' points. (c) Utilization of a BIC-maximized algorithm to determine the optimal implanted paths.](https://github.com/Haitao-Lee/auto_zygomatic_implantation/blob/main/fig/overview.png)

![Fig.2 The BIC index is represented by the number of points between cylindrical model 1 and cylindrical model 2, denoted as \(\rho_{i,k}\). And the optimal path is generated by maximizing \(\rho_{i,k}\) under  multiple constraints.](https://github.com/Haitao-Lee/auto_zygomatic_implantation/blob/main/fig/BICmaximization.png)
